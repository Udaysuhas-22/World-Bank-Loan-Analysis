# World-Bank-Loan-Analysis
This project analyzes World Bank loan data to understand the distribution, performance, and economic impact of loans across different countries and sectors. By utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, we identified trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform policymakers and economists on loan strategies and economic development.
